## Problem Domain

Everyone travels, but frequently are left wondering what to do in their new city. "Where is the best Japanese food?" "Are there cool local sights?" "Where can I get a taste of the local flavor?"... These are all questions we've faced while traveling. We want to create an app that will help these wayward travelers find their way in their travels
